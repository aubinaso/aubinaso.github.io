# Strategy
The customer need may be :
- Improve business agility
- Reduce costs
- Accelerate time to market
- Enable expansion into new markets

Rigorous documentation is required and must be understandable to cloud technicians and stakeholders.

## Define and document incentives
This is about answering the question 'Why are we moving to the cloud'. A rational answer must be given. It should not be a follow-my-leader or the result of an emotion, e.g. 'Our management is asking us to'.
Motivations can be :

| Advantage | Advantage |
|--|--|
| Exit from the data centre | Cost reduction
| Response to compliance changes | Reducing complexity related to vendors or technical constraints |
| Increased business agility | Improved control of expenditure Adaptation to new market demands (geographical) |
| Improved customer experience and engagement |  |

Motivations should be categorised according to whether they are
- a critical business event: migration should be undertaken in parallel with strategy and planning operations
- a benefit to migrate: a phased migration operation
- innovation : **the strategy and planning stages require more investment at the beginning of the process**

It is therefore necessary to have a clear understanding of the expected business outcomes to facilitate the conversations that need to be had with the customer that will further inform the documentation of the motivations
## Documenting business outcomes
During a cloud transformation, talking about business outcomes enables transparency and partnership between departments
- cost optimisation in the cloud. The issue of finance requires conversation between different parties who have a different view:
  - **Finance**: profitability of the company
  - **Marketing**: building customer loyalty and acquisition, building brand awareness
  - **Sales**: accelerate sales
  - **Human Resources**: retain, recruit and empower consultants
  - **Management**: market growth and environment
  - **Sustainability Manager**: sustainability

The results can be categorised as follows:
- Budgetary results
- Agility outcomes: speed to respond to and generate market changes
- Reach results: compliance of the company's geographical areas
- User engagement outcomes: meeting user need
- Performance outcomes: performance and reliability to enhance the company's reputation
- Sustainability outcomes: environmental and sustainability objectives
